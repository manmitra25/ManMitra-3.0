cd ../backend
npm install

# FastAPI (make sure Python virtual environment is activated)
cd ../fast_api
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **Configure API Keys**
Edit `fast_api/.env`:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-actual-gemini-api-key-here
```
**Get your key from**: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey

### 3. **Start All Services**
```powershell
# Method 1: Use the startup script
.\start-services.ps1

# Method 2: Start manually in separate terminals
# Terminal 1
cd fast_api
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2  
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 3
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 4. **Verify Services Are Running**
- ✅ FastAPI: http://localhost:8000 (should show "ManMitra AI Service is running")
- ✅ Backend: http://localhost:5000/health (should show "healthy")
- ✅ Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (ManMitra landing page)

### 5. **Test Core Features**

## 🎯 What's Working End-to-End

1. **User Registration & Login** → Database → JWT Tokens → Session Management
2. **Bestie Chat** → WebSocket → FastAPI AI → Gemini API → Response → WebSocket → Frontend
3. **Mood Assessments** → Form Submission → Backend API → MongoDB → Results Display
4. **Crisis Detection** → AI Analysis → Alert System → Resource Provision
5. **Real-time Updates** → WebSocket Connection → Live Chat → Notifications

## 🔧 Remaining Manual Tasks

The core integration is **COMPLETE**, but you may want to:

1. **Get Gemini API Key**: Required for AI chat functionality
2. **Test with Real Data**: Use the testing guide to verify everything works
3. **Customize Content**: Update mental health resources for your region
4. **Performance Tuning**: Monitor and optimize based on usage
5. **Deploy to Production**: Set up production environment

## 📝 Notes for Production

- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas is already configured
- **Environment Variables**: All sensitive data is properly externalized
- **Security**: JWT tokens, CORS, input validation all implemented
- **Monitoring**: Basic health checks implemented, expand as needed
- **Scalability**: WebSocket and API architecture supports horizontal scaling

## 🆘 If Something Doesn't Work

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for errors in all service windows
2. **Verify Ports**: Make sure 5000, 8000, 5173 are available
3. **Check Environment Files**: Ensure `.env` files are properly configured
4. **Follow Testing Guide**: Use `TESTING_GUIDE.md` for systematic testing
5. **MongoDB Connection**: Verify your Atlas connection is working
